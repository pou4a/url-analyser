# URL Analyzer

This repository contains both the **frontend** and **backend** applications for the url-analyser Challenge. The project is designed to manage URLs, analyze their content, and display crawl results.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   **Frontend**: A React-based application located in the `frontend-app` directory. It provides a user interface for submitting URLs, viewing the list of URLs, and analyzing crawl results.
-   **Backend**: A Go-based application located in the `go-backend-app` directory. It handles API requests, interacts with the database, and performs URL crawling.
-   **Database**: A MySQL database used to store URL data and crawl results.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running the app with Docker Compose)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (v3.8 or higher)

## Running the Project with Docker Compose

To run the entire project (frontend, backend, and database) using Docker Compose:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pou4a/url-analyser.git
    cd url-analyser
    ```

2. Build and start the services:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. Access the services:
    - **Frontend**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
    - **Backend**: The API is available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
    - **Database**: MySQL is running on port `3307` (default credentials are defined in `docker-compose.yml`).
